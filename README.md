# üõ°Ô∏è Gendered Abuse Detection in Indic Languages

A multilingual deep learning system for detecting **gendered abuse** in **Hindi, Tamil, and English** social media content. Built for the [ICON 2023 Shared Task on Gendered Abuse Detection](https://sites.google.com/view/icon2023-tattle-sharedtask/home), this solution incorporates multilingual BERT, domain-adaptive pretraining, and multi-task learning to handle code-mixing and under-resourced Indic languages.

---

##  Overview

We address three classification subtasks:

- **Task 1**: Detect gendered abuse (Label 1)
- **Task 2**: Incorporate external datasets for better transfer learning
- **Task 3**: Jointly predict gendered abuse (Label 1) and explicit language (Label 3)

<br>
<br>

- **Label 1** - Is this post gendered abuse when not directed at a person of marginalized gender and sexuality?
- **Label 2** - Is the post gendered abuse when directed at a person of marginalized gender and sexuality?
- **Label 3** - Is this post explicit/aggressive?

<br><br>
- The values for each label could be the following
- **1** - Indicates the annotator believes the post (tweet) matches the label.
- **0** - Indicates the annotator doesn‚Äôt believes the post (tweet) does not match the label.
- **NL** - The post was assigned to the annotator but not annotated.
- **NaN** - Indicates the post was not assigned to the annotator

##  Methodology

| Approach | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Baseline | mBERT with standard fine-tuning |
| Transfer Learning | Fine-tuned with external abusive datasets |
| Multi-task Learning | Custom architecture predicting both Label 1 & Label 3 |
| Preprocessing | Hinglish normalization, transliteration (Hindi) |

**External Data**:
- [Davidson Hate Speech](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language)
- MACD dataset (NeurIPS 2022)
